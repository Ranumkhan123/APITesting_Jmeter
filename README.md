# APITesting_Jmeter
JMeter: The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, API testing and load testing of web applications.
To test the this bookstore application, I have used JMETER. I performed GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods and also verify the results using differnet assertions like, JSON Assertions etc.I have also used While Controller to import data from the csv file.
